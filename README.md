IntelliVision is an advanced system for real-time monitoring of people flow and automatic facial recognition, combining the power of computer vision and machine learning.

🚀 Features
🔢 Automatic People Counting: Real-time detection and counting of people entering or leaving a monitored area.
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Facial Recognition: Automatically identifies registered individuals for tasks like attendance tracking in classrooms or controlled access to buildings.
👥 Presence Validation: Seamlessly register and validate the presence of individuals (ideal for classrooms or events).
🌐 Web-based Monitoring: User-friendly web interface to monitor people flow and control registered users.
🎦 Visual Feed with Data Overlay: Watch live video streams with person-count and recognition overlays for quick insights.
💻 Easy Integration: Simple to install, easy to extend, and customizable for different environments.
🛠 Technologies Used
Python 🐍: Core language for the application.
OpenCV 👁️: Powering real-time video processing and object detection.
Flask 🌍: Web framework providing a responsive interface.
NumPy 🔢: Handling numerical operations with efficiency.
SimpleFacerec 🧠: For facial recognition, integrated into presence validation.
cv2 📷: For handling video streams and image processing.
📸 How it Works
The system captures real-time video feeds and uses computer vision to:

📊 Count people moving across the defined area.
🟢 Track movement within specified zones (entry/exit lines).
🧑‍💼 Recognize faces of registered individuals, allowing for automatic attendance or controlled access.
📍 Overlay person count and recognition data on the video for a clear and immediate view.
You can monitor people flow, register new users, and validate attendance through an intuitive web interface.
